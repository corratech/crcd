    <p align="justify">AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates application deployments to your fleet of servers. Auto Scaling is a service that lets you dynamically scale your fleet based on load. Although these services are standalone, you can use them together for hands-free deployments! Whenever new Amazon EC2 instances are launched as part of an Auto Scaling group, CodeDeploy can automatically deploy your latest application revision to the new instances.</p>
