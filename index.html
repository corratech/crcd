    <p align="justify">AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates application deployments to your fleet of servers. Auto Scaling is a service that lets you dynamically scale your fleet based on load. Although these services are standalone, you can use them together for hands-free deployments! Whenever new Amazon EC2 instances are launched as part of an Auto Scaling group, CodeDeploy can automatically deploy your latest application revision to the new instances.</p>
    <p align="justify">If you haven’t set up CodeDeploy yet, that’s okay—it’s easy to get started. Step one is to make sure you have an EC2 instance running the CodeDeploy Agent. Make sure you tag the instance with something that is identifiable, because tags are one way that CodeDeploy identifies the instances it should add to the deployment group. Once you have an instance running, sign in to the CodeDeploy console and choose Create New Application. In CodeDeploy, an application is a namespace that AWS CodeDeploy uses to correlate attributes, such as what code should be deployed and from where.</p>
